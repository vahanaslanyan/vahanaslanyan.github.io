      <description>Very happy that my recent work has been published in Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp; Dementia. In this project, we have used data from Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial Memory and Cognition in Decreased Hypertension (SPRINT-MIND) magnetic resonance imaging sub-study to evaluate the association of cerebrovascular reactivity, a measure of brain blood vessel elasticity, with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. We found that cerebrovascular reactivity in AD signature regions is negatively associated with occurrence of mild cognitive impairment, implicating cerebrovascular reactivity in these signature regions as a potential mechanism leading to cognitive impairment.</description>
