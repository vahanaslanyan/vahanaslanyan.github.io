      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Biostatistics PhD student at University of Southern California. I am interested in adaptive designs for randomized controlled trials in Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s Disease. My dissertation focuses on:
Bayesian covariate-adjusted response adaptive randomization for continuous outcomes Sample size considerations for response adaptive randomized trials Interim decisions for response adaptive randomize trials with sample size re-estimation properties Before starting my PhD, I worked with neuroimaging data at USC INI. I have graduated from UC Berkeley with BA in Statistics and Applied Mathematics.</description>
