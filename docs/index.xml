      <description>Very happy that my recent work has been published in Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp; Dementia. In this project, we have used data from Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial Memory and Cognition in Decreased Hypertension (SPRINT-MIND) magnetic resonance imaging sub-study to evaluate the association of cerebrovascular reactivity, a measure of brain blood vessel elasticity, with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. We found that cerebrovascular reactivity in AD signature regions is negatively associated with occurrence of mild cognitive impairment, implicating cerebrovascular reactivity in these signature regions as a potential mechanism leading to cognitive impairment.</description>

      <description>1. Protective effects of sleep duration and physical activity on cognitive performance are influenced by amyloid beta and brain volume but not tau burden among cognitively unimpaired older adults. Event: Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s Association International Conference Date: July 17, 2023 Location: Amsterdam RAI Description: In this talk, I presented my findings about the mechanisms through which sleep and exercise influence cognition. 2. Protective effects of sleep duration and physical activity on cognitive performance are influenced by amyloid beta and brain volume Event: Monthly science meeting at ATRI Date: April 2022 Location: Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s Therapy and Research Institute, San Diego, CA Description: In this talk, I presented progress and findings to collaborators and professionals in the field.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Biostatistics PhD student at University of Southern California. I am interested in adaptive designs for randomized controlled trials in Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s Disease. My dissertation focuses on:
Bayesian covariate-adjusted response adaptive randomization for continuous outcomes Adjusting for effect modification in response adaptive randomization The utility of response adaptive randomization in platform trials Before starting my PhD, I worked with neuroimaging data at USC INI. I have graduated from UC Berkeley with BA in Statistics and Applied Mathematics.</description>
