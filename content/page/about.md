title: About me
---

I'm a Biostatistics PhD student at [University of Southern California](https://pphs.usc.edu/). I am interested in adaptive designs for randomized controlled trials in Alzheimer's Disease. My dissertation focuses on:

- Bayesian covariate-adjusted response adaptive randomization for continuous outcomes
- Adjusting for effect modification in response adaptive randomization
- The utility of response adaptive randomization in platform trials

Before starting my PhD, I worked with neuroimaging data at [USC INI](https://ini.usc.edu/). I have graduated from [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) with BA in Statistics and Applied Mathematics.

### Hobbies

I got my first indoor plant during the pandemic and am now a proud parent to 100+ plants. If you have a plant question or have an exotic cutting shoot me a message.
