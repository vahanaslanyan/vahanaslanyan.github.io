I'm a Biostatistics PhD student at [University of Southern California](https://pphs.usc.edu/). I am interested in response adaptive designs for randomized controlled trials. My dissertation focuses on:

- Bayesian covariate-adjusted response adaptive randomization for continuous outcomes
- Sample size considerations for response adaptive randomized trials
- Interim decisions for response adaptive randomize trials with sample size re-estimation properties

Before starting my PhD, I worked with neuroimaging data at [USC INI](https://ini.usc.edu/). I have graduated from [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) with BA in Statistics and Applied Mathematics.
